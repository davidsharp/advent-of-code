# David Sharp's Advent of Code solutions ðŸŽ„
This repo contains my (Node.js) solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)

I've been doing them since 2017, and typically I manage about half a month. I tend to write terse JS for my solutions

## Notes:
* 2017-2019: I maintained as Github Gists, and they live as a single file, run in Node
    * 2017: runs the most recent solution (unfortunately hard-coded), input file path is taken as an argument
    * 2018-2019: expects the input data to be piped in, like: `pbpaste | node aoc-2019 [day]`
* 2020: This year I want to write a more fully featured way of running each days solution, as well as breaking my usual monolith file into individual days
